# F1-Race-Strategy-Performance-Intelligence
The aim of this project is to analyze Formula 1 race data at a lap and event level to quantify how race strategy decisions—such as pit stop timing, qualifying position, and race pace consistency—impact driver performance and final race outcomes.

Instead of focusing only on who won the race, the project aims to explain why position changes happen during a race by linking strategy decisions to measurable performance metrics.
