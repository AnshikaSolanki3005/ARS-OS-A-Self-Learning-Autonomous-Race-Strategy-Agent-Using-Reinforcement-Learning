# ARS-OS: A Self-Learning Autonomous Strategy Agent Using Reinforcement Learning

The Autonomous Race Strategy Operating System (ARS-OS) is a self-learning AI system that uses reinforcement learning to make strategic decisions in a simulated race environment.

The system is designed to model race strategy as a sequential decision-making problem. At each step of a race, the agent observes the current race state — including factors such as tire wear, fuel level, and race progress — and selects an optimal strategy to maximize long-term performance.

Using a deep reinforcement learning approach, the agent learns to make decisions such as:

 - When to perform a pit stop

 - How to balance aggressive versus conservative driving

 - How to manage tire and fuel usage over the course of a race

Each action is executed within the simulated environment, and the agent receives feedback in the form of rewards based on race performance, resource efficiency, and strategic outcomes.

Through repeated interaction with the environment across multiple simulated races, the agent improves its decision-making policy over time. The final system demonstrates how autonomous agents can learn effective high-level strategies under uncertainty without relying on pre-existing datasets.
